## Tweety

Tweety is a social media very similar to Twitter. You can create a profile and post some tweets. Tweets have like/dislike
feature. Also, you can use the explorer tab in order to see other users' account. If you want, you can follow them, and then
you can see their tweets on your timeline.

In addition, you can edit your profile like changing you profile picture or your cover and also write a description about yourself.
